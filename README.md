# Css to the rescue process

## Project discription 
I wil de be experimenting with CSS techniques that are new (to me). I will be  creating an innovative, experimental, and enjoyable experience - using only vanilla HTML and vanilla CSS.

## Week 1

### Brainstorming Ideas 
It was time to start brainstorming some ideas. i went with the theme: **Modular Control panel** so it must controll something. 
I am currently very invested in wellness and different things that can help with improving yourself mentally and physically, so i started researching things we can implement in a controll pannel that can help you with "relaxing" and mindfullness practices.

- Breathwork/ beathing techniques
- Light therapy/ mood lighting
- Sounds
These are all things you could controll with the controllpannel to get yourself in the right mind space.

As you can kind off see in these sketches i want to make a controll pannel where you have different buttons and sliders etc where you can controll the lights and hue of the screens but also press the buttons to get different breathing techniques which i want to annimate with timing. Im still figuring out some extra features but i definetly want to play around and try to find/ do some cool stuff.

### Plan for next week.
For next week i want to focus on the smaller thing. Experement with the smaller parts for that i can put them all toghther at the end.

## Week 2

### Breathing Animations
I started with the breathwork animations right away because i thought these were going to be the hardest part. 
I was fairly new to animations: "keyframes". So i needed to do a lot of research. 
i learned about the animation name, duration and iteration count. So i tried them out on the "box breathing" and the "breathing circle" for now.

With the boxbreathing i needed 2 animations at the same time.

And the circle just needed a simple animation.

### Plan for next week
For next week i want to start by building the full picture. Like the structure and design elements of the full screen.
